Today is June 18th, 2025. I finally got my graduation certificate and bachelor's degree, which means a coming end of my undergraduate life. During my four years in university, I have gained a lot and grown tremendously. Through these four years of experience, I have acquired my own knowledge of economics and gradually clarified my life goals and ideals. In terms of personality, I have evolved from an impulsive teenager into someone more mature and thoughtful. In interpersonal relationships, I've learned how to better respect others, how to build appropriate relationships with different types of people, and how to become a reliable and trustworthy person. I'm very glad to have met many interesting friends during my university life, and I've gradually developed my own perspective on love while gaining more reflections about life.

Time flies. There's much to be cherished, friends, teachers, classmates, puppies and cats, teaching buildings, libraries, etc. Those who accompanied me through four years of college life, those unforgettable moments, are well worth my remembering in my whole life. Parting always lasts for a moment. Yesterday we were together, but tomorrow we will be separated by mountains and seas. 

May we all continue to progress toward our respective directions and have a happy and fulfilling life.
